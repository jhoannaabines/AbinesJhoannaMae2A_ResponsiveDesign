          <h1>Tips to Travel on a Budget</h1>
          <p>
              Traveling on a budget can be a rewarding and exciting experience. Here are three essential tips to help you make the most of your travels while keeping costs under control:

                  <img src="images/plan.png" alt="" />
                  <h3>Plan and Research in Advance</h3>
                  <p>
                      Start by setting a realistic budget for your trip, including transportation, accommodation, meals, activities, and any other expenses. Research and compare prices for flights, accommodations, and attractions to find the best deals. Look for budget-friendly destinations and consider traveling during off-peak seasons when prices tend to be lower.

                  <h3>Optimize Transportation and Accommodation</h3>
                  <p>
                      To save money on transportation, consider booking flights or tickets in advance, as prices tend to increase closer to the travel dates. Look for budget ferry services and be flexible with your travel dates to find the best deals. For accommodation, consider staying in budget-friendly options such as hostels, guesthouses, or vacation rentals.

                  <h3>Embrace Local Experiences and Cuisine</h3>
                  <p>
                      Exploring local experiences and trying local cuisine can be both cost-effective and rewarding. Instead of dining at touristy restaurants, opt for local eateries, street food stalls, or markets to sample authentic flavors at more affordable prices. Engage with locals and seek their recommendations for hidden gems and free or low-cost activities.

                          Then the same boat took us to Palad. This outcropping sandbar is in the middle of the sea. Depending on the prevailing tide. The sand bar may be below or out of the water. At the time of our visit, the sandbar was below the knees underwater. But we still got off the boat and frolicked in the water! There is a small port for wooden boats, and trips to the mainland and other islands are available. (Mar 2020)

                          Affordable prices, a very relaxing place to unwind, and a sanctuary I like to stay at Wawie's Beach Resort. I can sleep in their native bamboo room cabin and go around within this small islet and roam. (Apr 2019)
